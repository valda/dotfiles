## Code Style & Standards

### Indentation
- 2 spaces: Ruby, JS/TS, HTML/ERB, CSS
- 4 spaces: Python

### Naming Conventions
- Java:        PascalCase classes, camelCase methods
- JavaScript:  camelCase vars & funcs, PascalCase React/Svelte components
- Ruby/Python: snake_case everything, PascalCase modules/classes
- HTML/CSS:    kebab-case class-names & IDs

### Code Quality
- Use descriptive English for variables & functions
- Keep functions small (single responsibility principle)
- Add error handling & edge-case guards by default
- Prefer self-documenting code; comment only for non-obvious intent

## Development Workflow

### Design Process
- Present alternatives & trade-offs when proposing solutions
- Maintain strict separation of concerns
- Prefer pure functions & dependency injection for testability
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

### Documentation
- **Conventional Commits** in Japanese
- Subject line â‰¤ 50 chars; body as 80-col wrapped sentences
- Include inline docstrings/comments summarizing purpose

## AI Assistant Interaction

### Technical Approach
- Ask for clarification rather than hallucinate
- Surface uncertainty explicitly (`TODO`, `FIXME`, inline comments)
- Provide reasoning behind suggestions; flag issues early
- Offer naming suggestions when ambiguity exists
